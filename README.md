# arborkart

Phylogenomic trees with maps for the web

# Introduction

This repo is a placeholder for my dream of a reliable Javascript widget
I can just give a tree (.nwk) and a metadata table (.tsv) and it will 
use the `lat` and `lng` columns for map icons and the rest for metadata
next to the tree nodes on a dendrogram

# Etymology

From _arbor_ (tree) and _cart_ (map).
